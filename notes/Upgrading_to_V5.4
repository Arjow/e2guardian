Upgrading to V5.4 from e2guardian v5.3

If you are upgrading from v4 please read notes/Upgrading_to_V5 first.

There are changes to both the configuration files, mainly in the definition
of auth plugins, 

Both the e2guardian.conf and e2guardianf1.conf contain some new list definitions.  

Some new list types are introduced. Including maplist, ipmaplist and mapport all
of which are used to map users/ip/ports to filter groups
Details of the new list types definition are in notes/V5_list_definition.pdf. 

A number of settings have been moved into new Storyboard config files. 
These are noted in the example e2guardian.conf and e2guardianf1.conf files.

For details on Storyboard syntax see notes/V5_Storyboard.pdf


UPGRADE PROCEDURE

Before upgrading make a backup of all your existing configuration & lists. You will
may need to refer to these after the install.

Install E2guardian V5.4 in a clean area.

****** Edit to here ******

Edit e2guardian.conf to your requirements. If you are going to use 
transparent mode set the default group for transparent mode.  
Leave proxy_ip commented out unless you need to use an upstream proxy.

Edit each e2guardianfn.conf to your requirements.

Using examplef1.story as a template create a fn.story for each filtergroup, 
actioning any blanket block required.

If you want to use tranparent https mode redirect port 443 to 8443.
